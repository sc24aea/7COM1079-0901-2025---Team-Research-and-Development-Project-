Group Project Report

In this assignment, our group will work on gun-deaths-by-county-QueryResult dataset and develop both a research question (RQ) and a corresponding hypothesis, produce visualisations and statistical analysis. The research question defines a specific claim or issue to be investigated, forming the starting point for building and testing a meaningful argument. The hypothesis provides a proposed explanation or prediction that can be examined through data analysis. Together, they guide the direction of the study by clarifying what evidence is needed, how it will be evaluated, and how effectively it can support or challenge a particular position. 

The research questions allowed by this assignment will be one of three types:

establishing a difference in means between two groups

establishing a difference in proportion between two groups

establishing a correlation between two measures
